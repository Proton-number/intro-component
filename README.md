## Overview
This is a solution of another front-end mentor challenge i decided to take so i could work more on my material-ui skills. This is my third project using the technology and yeah, i've improved by learning new props and new ways of oveerwritting default properties.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process
 I still have little issues with adjusting to use Material Ui tags instead of regular html5 tags.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Material Ui


### What I learned
I learnt new ways to align items on a webpage, adding colors and changing fontFamily with createTheme and ThemeProvider. Took a while to grab to be honest ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. After a few articles, i got my way around it. Use Microsoft's color picker too to get colors of each element easily. I'm learning how to write more inline material ui code. It's a little tough due to being used to writing html for like two years now. 


### Continued development
In future projects, i plan to learn alot more on react and get better with each new project. Build my new projects with Material-Ui and implement framer-motion too. I want to learn to write less css code and to make responsive webpages and smoother UI.
